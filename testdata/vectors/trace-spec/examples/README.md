# TRACE v0.2 example Trust Records

Each file in this directory is a canonical TRACE v0.2 Trust Record that validates
as-is against `schema/trace-claim.json` (no preprocessing, no comment stripping).

These records are unsigned, so they are **Level 0** artifacts: they show the record
shape and the claim set, not a cryptographically verifiable record. Check them with

```bash
pip install agentrust-trace-tests
trace-tests verify --record examples/amd-sev-snp.json --level 0
```

At `--level 1` and above every one of them fails `TR-SIG-005` by design, because
Level 1 requires a signature and `TR-SIG` fails closed. Signed records are produced
by cmcp at runtime; see [docs/quickstart.md](../docs/quickstart.md) to sign your own.
`TR-ENV-002` also enforces a 24-hour maximum record age, so pass `--max-age` when
checking any archived record, including these.

- `intel-tdx.json`: Intel TDX example.
- `amd-sev-snp.json`: AMD SEV-SNP example.
- `nvidia-h100.json`: NVIDIA H100 Confidential Computing example.
- `tpm2.json`: TPM 2.0 example.
- `sandbox-runtime.json`: a sandboxed agent runtime in the shape a `tpm2` attestation
  produces. Its measurement, nonce and key are placeholders; see
  `docs/integration/sandbox-runtime.md`. Produced by `TraceSandboxAdapter`; the decision
  log is a kernel-sandbox policy trace rather than MCP tool calls.
- `action-receipts/`: informative fixture shapes for action-level receipt
  verification. These are not TRACE Trust Records and are not validated against
  `schema/trace-claim.json`.
- `build-provenance-depth/`: six vectors that separate the three depths a verifier can
  stop at when checking `build_provenance`. Each is accepted by the depth below it and
  rejected by the depth in its filename, so a verifier's stopping point is visible in
  its verdicts. Informative: not Trust Records, not validated against
  `schema/trace-claim.json`. See that directory's README.
- `reproducibility-claim/`: 21 signed Trust Records that pin the shape rules spec
  section 3.1.4 states for the `reproducibility` claim and its `appraisal.re_execution`
  result: two vectors per rule and five accepting records. Each file is a test-vector
  envelope; the record is under `record`, and the digests the claim carries recompute
  from the JSON under `context`. See that directory's README.
- `canonicalization-boundary/`: three signed Trust Records that separate an
  RFC 8785-conformant canonicalizer from `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`, which
  §3.2.2 requires and names as insufficient. Each file is a test-vector envelope;
  the Trust Record is under the `record` key and validates against the schema.
  See that directory's README.
- `condition-appraisal/`: five signed Trust Records, each citing an independent check's
  finding through a `references` entry with `rel: "condition-appraisal"`, against an
  appraisal store committed beside them: confirmed, altered after issue, a fail that
  verifies exactly as the pass does, unresolvable, and an issuer whose key the relying
  party does not hold. Every digest recomputes; see that directory's README and
  `docs/references-registry.md`.

The schema sets `additionalProperties: false`, so examples must not carry
non-schema keys such as `_comment`. Keep descriptive notes in this file.
