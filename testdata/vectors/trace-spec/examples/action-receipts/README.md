# Action receipt verification examples

These examples describe the fixture shapes used by embodied-action profiles
that attach per-action receipts below a TRACE Trust Record. They are informative
only: the JSON snippets are not TRACE Trust Records and are not validated by
`schema/trace-claim.json`.

The examples exercise the boundary from
[spec section 3.3.3](../../spec/trace-v0.2.md#333-action-receipts-for-embodied-workflows-informative):

1. session evidence verifies the Trust Record and committed transcript;
2. action issuance evidence verifies that a consequential action request was
   signed, ordered, and bound to the session or call; and
3. outcome evidence reports what an external controller or monitor decided.

## Shared receipt shape

An action receipt profile can represent each externally consequential action as
a transcript entry plus a detached receipt:

```json
{
  "call_id": "call-7f31",
  "session_id": "trace-session-2026-07-05T09:42:11Z",
  "action_ref": "sha256:...",
  "controller_target": "did:web:factory.example:cell-a:robot-arm-2",
  "requested_scope": "cell-a.pick.place",
  "receipt": {
    "issuer": "did:web:factory.example:safety-controller",
    "issuer_key_id": "did:web:factory.example:safety-controller#ed25519-2026q3",
    "linked_call_id": "call-7f31",
    "session_id": "trace-session-2026-07-05T09:42:11Z",
    "evidence_type": "application/vnd.agentrust.action-receipt+json",
    "evidence_hash": "sha256:...",
    "previous_receipt_hash": "sha256:...",
    "decision": "accepted",
    "signature": "base64url..."
  }
}
```

The verifier checks the receipt independently of the core Trust Record:

- recompute `action_ref` or `evidence_hash` from the canonical action preimage;
- resolve `issuer_key_id` through a pinned, manifest-bound, or otherwise trusted
  key set;
- verify the signature with `signature` removed from the canonical receipt;
- verify `linked_call_id` and `session_id` match the expected transcript entry;
- verify `previous_receipt_hash` when the profile uses hash-chain ordering; and
- report the receipt result separately from the controller decision.

## Conformance fixtures

The files under `conformance/` provide machine-checkable cases for the
informative action-receipt rules. The fixtures use
`trace.action_receipt.conformance.v0` as a test-profile identifier. This
fixture set leaves the TRACE wire profile and `schema/trace-claim.json`
unchanged.

Each fixture contains:

- `context`, which supplies the expected session, call, receipt-chain
  predecessor, and freshness policy;
- `action`, including the canonical action preimage and its `action_ref`;
- `trusted_issuer_keys`, keyed by the pinned `issuer_key_id`;
- detached `evidence` and a signed `receipt`, except in the missing-receipt
  case; and
- `expected`, which records the result, controller outcome, failure codes, and
  warnings a conforming verifier should return.

The fixture contract uses RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) bytes for
three operations:

1. `action_ref` is SHA-256 over `agent_id`, `action_type`, `action_scope`, and
   `action_timestamp`.
2. `evidence_hash` is SHA-256 over the detached `evidence` object.
3. The Ed25519 signature covers the receipt object with only `signature`
   removed. The verifier resolves the key through `trusted_issuer_keys`; the
   receipt cannot authenticate itself with an embedded key.

| Fixture | Receipt result | Controller outcome | Required interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-valid-controller-accepted.json` | `receipt_valid_accepted` | `accepted` | The controller accepted the bound action. Physical completion remains unproven. |
| `02-valid-controller-rejected.json` | `receipt_valid_rejected` | `aborted` | The verifier accepts the signed abort as valid negative evidence. |
| `03-missing-required-receipt.json` | `receipt_missing_required` | unknown | The profile required a receipt and the action has none. |
| `04-signature-key-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The signature does not verify under the pinned issuer key. |
| `05-action-ref-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The signed receipt binds to a different action. |
| `06-stale-receipt.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The authentic receipt falls outside the configured freshness window. |
| `07-receipt-chain-gap.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The receipt does not link to the expected predecessor. |
| `08-same-party-self-report.json` | `receipt_valid_accepted` with warning | `accepted` | The evidence verifies, but the issuer is not independent from the gateway. |
| `09-unsupported-physical-completion.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | Base TRACE cannot verify the asserted physical-completion claim. |
| `10-action-ref-not-recomputable.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The declared `action_ref` is not the digest of its own preimage, so it binds nothing. |
| `11-call-id-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | An authentic receipt bound to a different call. |
| `12-session-id-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | An authentic receipt from a different session. |
| `13-evidence-hash-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The receipt is authentic but the detached evidence was swapped after signing. |
| `14-receipt-issuer-key-unknown.json` | `receipt_unverified` with advisory | unknown | The issuer key is not in the verifier's pinned set. Unverifiable is not invalid (spec §3.3.2): no trust is conferred and no forgery is proven, surfaced as an `issuer_key_unknown` advisory. |
| `15-receipt-from-future.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | Issued after the verification time, so an upper bound on age never rejects it. |
| `16-decision-not-in-enum.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | An unrecognised decision verb, which must not read as accept or reject. |
| `17-missing-receipt-explicit-null.json` | `receipt_missing_required` | unknown | The receipt supplied as an explicit `null`: 03's absence through a different door, misread by presence-checking implementations. |
| `18-action-ref-tail-forged.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The declared `action_ref` matches the recomputed digest in every character but the last. |
| `19-action-ref-mismatch-in-tail.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | Receipt and action references differ only in the final character. |
| `20-call-id-case-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The linked call id is this call's id in a different case — a different call. |
| `21-session-id-case-mismatch.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The session id in a different case — a different session. |
| `22-evidence-hash-mismatch-in-tail.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The evidence hash is wrong only in its final character. |
| `23-receipt-issuer-key-case-variant.json` | `receipt_unverified` with advisory | unknown | The right key pinned under a case-variant of the receipt's key id: not the key the receipt names. |
| `24-receipt-signature-malformed.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | Valid base64url decoding to 32 bytes — rejected by structure, where 04 needs cryptography. |
| `25-stale-receipt-boundary.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | Stale by exactly one second. |
| `26-receipt-from-future-boundary.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | Issued one second after the verification time. |
| `27-receipt-chain-gap-in-tail.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The predecessor link is wrong only in its final character. |
| `28-physical-completion-claim-case.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The claim `"None"`: the vocabulary word under case-normalisation, outside it as bytes. |
| `29-same-party-self-report-rejected.json` | `receipt_valid_rejected` with warning | `rejected` | A gateway self-report on the rejected branch: issuer independence matters on both. |
| `30-decision-case-variant.json` | `receipt_invalid` | unknown | The decision `"Accepted"`: in the vocabulary case-insensitively, outside it as bytes. |

Fixtures `10`–`16` each pin down one rule that the verifier applies and that no fixture
previously exercised. Every one was a check a conforming implementation could have
omitted entirely while passing this set. Two matter beyond tidiness: without
`issuer_key_unknown` a receipt authenticates itself — a signature verifies against
whatever key it names, and only the pinned set decides which keys the verifier can
check at all; per spec §3.3.2 the outcome is `receipt_unverified`, not
`receipt_invalid`, but a verifier that never consults its pinned set would report such
a receipt as fully valid, which is what the vector distinguishes. Without
`evidence_hash_mismatch` the signature covers a digest whose document may have been
replaced.

Fixtures `17`–`30` are the second, independent vector for each rule. Two vectors are
independent when a single implementation defect causes one to pass and the other to
fail (#124), and each pair here is split by a declared, plausible shortcut: truncated
digest comparison, case-normalised identifier matching, clock tolerance, structural
signature validation, presence-checking instead of null-checking. The defect that
separates each pair is declared and enforced in
`tests/test_vector_completeness.py::DEFECTS`.

Everything from `10` up pins its own deterministic test key, since the private half of
the key used by `01`–`09` is not published; `gen_rule_coverage_vectors.py` regenerates
the range byte-for-byte and only public JWKs appear in the files.

Reissuing `01`–`09` from published keys takes two of them, not one (#178). `04` is the
only vector whose issuer key the verifier holds and whose 64-byte signature still fails
to verify, which is the shape that separates it from `24`. A single key can keep that
shape, by corrupting the signature at fixed length; what it cannot keep is the fixture's
meaning, a signature made by a key the verifier does not hold. The guard below sees the
shape and not the signer, so the second key is a decision the reissue makes on purpose
rather than one a test enforces. `tests/vector_roles.json` records which vector carries
which discrimination, and `test_no_vector_has_lost_its_role` fails by name if a reissue
drops one.

`tests/test_action_receipt_fixtures.py` recomputes each digest, verifies each
signature against the pinned key, checks session and call binding, enforces
freshness and receipt-chain ordering, and compares the result with each
fixture's `expected` object. The tests need no ROS installation or network
access.

The pinned JWKs and signatures are public test material. Deployments must use
their own trusted issuer keys.

## Boundary

A valid action receipt proves that a trusted issuer signed a statement about a
specific action request under a specific session or call binding. It does not,
by itself, prove that the physical action completed, that the real world changed
as intended, or that a functional-safety standard was satisfied.

Profiles that need stronger outcome claims should define the external issuer,
certification basis, and verifier trust anchor for those claims explicitly,
without making them part of base TRACE validity.
