# An independent check's finding as a `condition-appraisal` reference

A TRACE Trust Record can point at what an independent check found when it held a
deliverable against a stated condition: a test run, a schema validation, a contract
check, a reviewer's signed verdict. These fixtures show that composition. Each record
carries one `references` entry with `rel: "condition-appraisal"`, and its `digest` is
the SHA-256 of the RFC 8785 canonical form of the appraisal object as the resolver
retains it.

The relation is defined in [`docs/references-registry.md`](../../docs/references-registry.md).
What a relying party may establish from a resolved reference is bounded to the object:
that the resolved bytes are the cited bytes, and, under an issuer key it holds, that the
named issuer signed them. Neither reaches the record: under §3.1.2 rule 3 it verifies the
same whether the reference resolves or not, and nothing in the object becomes attested
evidence. A `pass` is not attested evidence that the condition held, and a `fail` is not
a finding against the record. Cases `01` and `03` are the same record shape citing a
pass and a fail, and they verify identically.

Everything here derives from one published seed through
[`gen_condition_appraisal_vectors.py`](gen_condition_appraisal_vectors.py), so the set
regenerates byte for byte; the issuer, the condition and the deliverable are
illustrative, and every digest and signature recomputes from the committed files.
[`tests/test_condition_appraisal_fixtures.py`](../../tests/test_condition_appraisal_fixtures.py)
recomputes every verdict from those bytes rather than reading it from `expected.json`,
and re-runs the generator against the committed files.

## The referenced object

`appraisal-store.json` holds three appraisal objects by identifier. Each one carries:

| Member | What it is |
|---|---|
| `type` | `condition-appraisal` |
| `issuer`, `issuer_key_id` | The party that performed the check, and the RFC 7638 thumbprint of its Ed25519 key |
| `condition.id`, `condition.digest` | The criteria the subject was held against; the digest is over the RFC 8785 form of the value in `context.json` |
| `subject.id`, `subject.digest` | The deliverable that was checked; the digest is over the RFC 8785 form of its manifest in `context.json` |
| `outcome.status`, `outcome.vocabulary`, `outcome.detail` | The finding, in the issuer's own closed vocabulary, which the object names |
| `issued_at` | When the issuer signed |
| `signature` | Ed25519 over the RFC 8785 canonical form of the object without this member |

## Fixture cases

Expected results are machine-readable in [`expected.json`](expected.json). Every record
verifies as a TRACE record; what differs is what the reference resolves to.

| Record | Store | Reference | Digest | Issuer key held | Issuer signature | Outcome | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `01-appraisal-confirmed.json` | `appraisal-store.json` | resolves | matches | yes | verifies | `pass` | appraisal confirmed |
| `02-appraisal-altered-after-issue.json` | `appraisal-store-altered.json` | resolves | **differs** | yes | **fails** | `pass` | appraisal contradicted |
| `03-outcome-is-a-fail.json` | `appraisal-store.json` | resolves | matches | yes | verifies | **`fail`** | appraisal confirmed |
| `04-reference-unresolvable.json` | `appraisal-store.json` | **no such entry** | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | appraisal unconfirmed |
| `05-issuer-key-not-configured.json` | `appraisal-store.json` | resolves | matches | **no** | not checked | `pass` | appraisal unverified |

`02` is `appraisal/2`, issued as a `fail`, rewritten in the stored copy as a `pass` after
the record was issued. Both checks catch it independently: the record's digest no
longer matches, and the issuer's signature no longer verifies over the rewritten bytes.

`03` cites the same `appraisal/2` from the unaltered store. The finding is a `fail`, the
record verifies exactly as `01` does, and the relying party reports the outcome without
promoting it in either direction.

`04` is what §3.1.2 rule 3 requires: a verifier must not reject a record because a
reference cannot be resolved. The record verifies, and the appraisal it points at is
reported as unconfirmed, which is a different answer from "no appraisal".

`05` cites an appraisal signed by an issuer whose key this relying party does not hold.
The rule §3.3.2 gives receipts applies: unverified, not invalid. The cited bytes are
the cited bytes; whether the named issuer signed them is not established.

## Running the checks

```
python -m pytest tests/test_condition_appraisal_fixtures.py
```

To regenerate, run the generator with no arguments. It is deterministic, so the
committed files only change when the generator does.
